Outside of the home there is so much ultra-processed food. We can avoid it by "making" our own meals.

CARBS
rice/corn/oat cakes
popcorn

PROTEIN
yoghurt (need spoon)
nuts (cheapest)
hummus (dip)
cheese sliced

FRUIT/VEG
carrot
cucumber
lettuce
apple > satsuma etc. > other fruit

EXAMPLES
rice cake dipped in hummus
nuts
apple

corn cakes with layers of cheese and lettuce
yogurt with random spoon

oat cakes with cucumber and cheese?


A simpler option (but more expensive) is to go to a nice restaurant. Have someone else do the cooking (who won't add any additives to your food)
