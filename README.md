# food
A long time ago humans were eating what they could find. We evolved to do some processing of our food outside of our bodies through the use of heat (cooking). Our jaws became small and our digestive system shorter.

We use capitalism everywhere. Companies are pressured to find ways to make more money. This is good and bad. The climate suffers. Our food suffers. Companies are incentivised to get you to eat as much of there food and to produce that food the cheapest way possible. In 2023 that means that all ingredients can be subsititued for a more palatable cheaper to produce ingredient. These are additives. For example an additive may emulate the taste of a natural fat like butter. But it isn't butter.

In the UK and other countries there have been attempts to stop the rise of obesity. One government method was to condemn fats. Saturated fats were avoided. Obesity kept rising. Then sugars were replaced with sweetners. Obseity kept rising. Now, starting in Brazil, the aim is to reduce ultra-processed food. These foods with additives. Replacements for the "real"/"whole" ingredients.
